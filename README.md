Sure, here's a basic low-level design for a system that uses the New York Times API to fetch and display articles:

1. **Frontend (React Application)**: The frontend is responsible for displaying the articles to the user. It consists of several components:

   - `ArticleList`: Fetches the list of articles from the backend and displays them. Each article in the list is represented by an `ArticleList` component.
   
   - `ArticleList`: Displays a brief overview of an article (e.g., title, images). When clicked, it navigates to the `ArticleDetail` page for that article.
   
   - `ArticleDetail`: Fetches all the articles again as New York times don't provide article fetch by ID.

   - `useFetch`: Use one of the hooks in react to call api and fetch data. This is common is use commonly in all component to call apis.

2. **Backend (Express Server)**: Using New York times apis to fetch and display articles:

   - `mostpopular/v2/viewed/1.json`: Fetches the most popular articles from the New York Times API and returns them to the frontend.
   
   
3. **New York Times API**: The backend communicates with the New York Times API to fetch article data. It uses the `Most Popular API` to fetch the most popular articles and the `Article Search API` to fetch detailed information about a specific article.

4. **Environment Variables**: The API key for the New York Times API is stored as an environment variable. This keeps the key secure and allows it to be easily changed if necessary.

This design assumes that the New York Times API provides an endpoint to fetch detailed information about a specific article by its ID, which is not the case. As I mentioned in my previous message, you may need to find another data source or use web scraping to get detailed information about specific articles.

Please note that this is a very basic design and doesn't include many details that would be necessary in a real-world application, such as error handling, caching, authentication, and more.

4. **CSS STYLING**: For styling we are using ChakraUI to display the most popular articles in boxes.

No CSS styling is writing manually, all predefined CSS styles are are use from Chakra UI components.
